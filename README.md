## Project Description

Have the Github users from the Effect Network interact and with you open source repositories to get more traction. The Effect workforce allows projects to easily tap into a fitting audience for their Github pages.

## Summary

GitStar a pure Effect Network dApp with some unique features:

- The contract any Effect account to order stars (requester private key not required!)
